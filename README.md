This is a research project. To dataset was stored in the folder “Mangrove Detection.v6i.yolov8", stored in this [Google Drive]([url](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-MO_hpmxthjhIZpfaFuaQoce7LfbK1i2?usp=sharing)) 

FYP2_YOLO_MangroveDetection.ipynb- this file is the code of the training and comparison for YOLO variations for the adoption of the baseline model. 

The trained model was saved and named as “(N)yolov8s_model4.pt”.

HTD .ipynb- To test the model, open up this HTD.ipynb file and run the code accordingly, where paths are to modified base on the image and models location path.
